## Mission

- Register a raid that is happening
- View a map of raids happening
- Get alerts when there is a raid happening withing a 50 mile radius (radius is subject to change)
- Display a feed of social media content on a specific hashtag (hashtag up for discussion)

## How to join the project

We will be using the list items in the *Mission* section (above) as user stories. These, along with some others, will be submitted as issues in the repo.

People can take on an issue, work on it, and submit a pull request when ready.

We will also be experimenting with [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) for worklow, so be sure to install that browser plugin to see the cool extra interfaces ZenHub provides.
