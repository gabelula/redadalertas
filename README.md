# Redadas-de-obama
A web app for crowdsourcing immigration raid info so undocumented people can avoid them. To be hosted on [RedadasDeObama.com](http://RedadasDeObama.com).

**This is an experiment of combining rapid response online activism with web app development.**

## Mission

Create a web app where people can do the following things:
- Register a raid that is happening
- View a map of raids happening
- Get alerts when there is a raid happening withing a 50 mile radius (radius is subject to change)
- Display a feed of social media content on a specific hashtag (hashtag up for discussion)

## How we plan to do it

This is gonna be a fast moving project. For that reason, we will be using the [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com) framework using React as the templating for front end.

## Timeline

Again, pretty rushed. Let's shoot for a deadline of launching by May 27, 2016.

## How to join the project

We will be using the list items in the *Mission* section (above) as user stories. These, along with some others, will be submitted as issues in the repo.

People can take on an issue, work on it, and submit a pull request when ready.

We will also be experimenting with [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) for worklow, so be sure to install that browser plugin to see the cool extra interfaces ZenHub provides.


## Contributor Covenant

The maintainer of this project is committed to making sure this project provides a safe space for people of all genders, races, and levels of programmer proficiency. Everyone has something valuable to contribute.

We will also enforce our [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) should you engage in behaviors not in line with the project's, and Movimiento Cosecha's values.

## Running the Web App on your machine

You need to have the following installed:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Meteor.js Framework](http://meteor.com)

Once you have that installed, run the following in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/Cosecha/redadas-de-obama.git`

Then move into that directory:

`cd redadas-de-obama`

Now to make sure you have all you NPM dependencies (you may need to use `sudo` before):

`npm init`

Now to start the meteor app:

`meteor`

You should now be able to visit the app running on your computer at `http://localhost:3000`:
